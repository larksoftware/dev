* dev

A utility I used to create tmux sessions for my various projects.
I've included the shell script I based this project from as a
reference.

There is a default configuration it will use to create 4 windows,
which suits my typical workflow.  Or you can create a ~.dev.json~ file
and setup a custom session.

#+BEGIN_SRC json
{
  "session": "app-name",
  "windows": [
    {
      "name": "first-window-name",
      "actions": ["commands to execute in that window"],
      "pwd": "./directory/to/change/to",
      "select": true // true if you want this window selected after the session starts
    },
    {
      "name": "second-window",
      "actions": ["commands to execute in this window"],
      "pwd": "./directory/to/change/to",
      "select": false
    }
  ]
}
#+END_SRC
